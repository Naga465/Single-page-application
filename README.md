# Single-page-application
Run :

   npm install
	
   npm start
   
  Project is running on http://localhost:8080/

 In a single page application, we have solved this problem, by using a fundamentally different architectural approach:
 We can design these application using Basic Js frameworks like React or we can use Angular.But here i am using the 
 
  React
  
  Redux
  
  It is more like maintaing the State and updating state when ever event is happend.So in this only we have to search for  particular thing it can be passed through props and call the YT search Api, it inside it will fetch the requested to that key.
 Response from that api is Json format of particular video informatin and url.This response we can use Render the videous.
